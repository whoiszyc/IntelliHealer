**IntelliHealer**: An imitation and reinforcement learning platform for self-healing distribution networks.
IntelliHealer uses imitation learning framework to learn restoration policy for distribution system service restoration so as to perform the restoration actions (tie-line switching and reactive power dispatch) in real time and in embedded environment.

Such **embeddable** and **computation-free** policies allows us to integrate the self-healing capability into intelligent devices.
A polit project conducted by the `S&C Electric <https://www.sandc.com/en/>`_ can be found `here <https://www.sandc.com/en/solutions/self-healing-grids/>`_.
For details of this work, please refer to our paper at `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14458/>`_ or `IEEE <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9424985?denied=>`_.

Features
========
- IntelliHealer proposes the imitation learning framework, which improve the sample efficiency using a mixed-integer program-based expert compared with the traditional exploration-dominant reinforcement learning algorithms.

- IntelliHealer proposes a hierarchical policy network, which can accommodate both discrete and continuous actions.

- IntelliHealer provides an `OpenAI-Gym <https://gym.openai.com>`_ environment for distribution system restoration, which can be connected to `Stable-Baselines3 <https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master>`_, a state-of-the-art collection of reinforcement learning algorithms.
  Currently, the Gym environment contains two test feeders: 33-node and 119-node system.
